# 🔥 Smart Fire Detection System (IoT + AI) – FireForecaster

## 🚀 Overview
Every year, over 12,000 lives are lost in India due to delayed fire alerts in homes. While offices use smart detection systems that alert authorities instantly, homes still rely on outdated smoke alarms that lack communication capabilities.

**Our solution:** An AI-powered IoT system that detects, predicts, and alerts in real-time, and cuts electrical power to prevent further damage — providing critical response time to save lives and property.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

> **"When a fire strikes, every second counts."**  
Homes lack real-time, automated fire alert systems unlike advanced office setups. The result: delayed response, increased casualties, and property loss.

**Goal:** Build an affordable, smart IoT-based fire detection system for homes using AI and real-time alerting.

## ✅ Solution Highlights

- 🔍 **Early Detection**: IoT sensors detect temperature, gas, and smoke changes.
- 📹 **AI Forecasting**: Live camera streams and environment data predict fire risk using ML.
- 📲 **Real-time Alerts**: Sends instant alerts to user phones and fire stations via cloud.
- 🚨 **Automated Response**: Activates alarms and emergency contacts instantly.
- ⚡ **Power Shutdown**: Automatically **cuts electricity** when a fire is confirmed to prevent short circuits or escalation.
- 🌐 **Web Dashboard**: Displays live sensor readings, fire alerts, and power cut status.
